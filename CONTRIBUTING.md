below to get started.

## Environment Setup

Once you've cloned the repository, you'll need to get your working environment
set up before you can make changes.

### Virtual Environment

We recommend using a virtual environment to keep your environment isolated for
your work on this project. You can do this easily through the terminal. Note
that the project is intended to work with Python 3.6 or later, so we recommend
that you configure your interpreter to use Python 3.6.

On Linux:
```bash
$ python3 -m venv path/to/virtual_environment_directory # create
$ source path/to/virtual_environment_directory/bin/activate # activate
```

On Windows:
```shell
> python -m venv path\to\virtual_environment_directory # create
> path\to\virtual_environment_directory\Scripts\activate # activate
```

Python IDE's generally have built-in support for virtual environments, so you
can also set up a virtual environment through your IDE. Here are instructions
for setting up a virtual environment in some popular IDE's:
* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html)
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments)
